**Last Updated: January 16, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how Han Launcher ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information.

### 1. Information We Collect
Han Launcher is designed with privacy in mind.
*   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data (such as IP addresses, names, or emails) to our servers.
*   **Local Data:** User preferences (like your Survivor Name and launch settings) are stored locally on your device in `localStorage`.
*   **Discord Rich Presence:** If enabled, the App sends limited status information (e.g., "Playing DayZ") to the Discord client running on your device. This data is handled by Discord in accordance with their privacy policy.

### 2. How We Use Information
*   **Local Preferences:** Used solely to persist your settings between sessions.
*   **Steam Data:** We access your local Steam client to verify ownership of DayZ and manage mods. We do not transmit this data externally.

### 3. Third-Party Services
*   **BattleMetrics:** The App queries the BattleMetrics API to retrieve server lists. Your IP address may be visible to BattleMetrics when these requests are made, subject to their privacy policy.
*   **Discord:** Interaction with Discord Rich Presence is subject to Discord's Privacy Policy.

### 4. User Choice
You can control the following:
*   **Discord Privacy:** You can toggle "Show Server on Discord" in the Identity settings to hide your specific server location.
